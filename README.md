UFOs(well, they are not really flying) learning to drive.

## Neural Network + Genetic Algorithm approach
UFOs are guided by a feedforward fully connected neural network whose weights are found using genetic algorithm.

## Reinforcement learning approach
Q-learning combined with a neural network as a function approximator. DQN algorithm is used.
